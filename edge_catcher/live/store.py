"""``SQLiteTradeStore`` — the live-only ``TradeStoreProtocol`` adapter.

Owned by sub-project B (v1.6.0 PR 5). This is the thin, stateful
connection-holding bridge between the engine's *structural*
``engine.trade_store.TradeStoreProtocol`` (what ``engine/dispatch.py`` calls)
and B's *pure-function* ``live.state`` writers over ``live_trades.db``.

``live.state`` is deliberately stateless free functions
(``record_pending(conn, *, ...)``) so the reconciler and WS handlers can call
them over whatever connection sub-project E owns. Dispatch, however, is written
against an *object* with methods. This class is the seam: it holds ONE
``sqlite3.Connection`` to ``live_trades.db`` (WAL + the ``0003`` migration
applied at construction via 4.A's ``connect_live_trades_db`` helper) and
delegates each Protocol method dispatch reaches on the LIVE path to the
matching ``live.state`` / ``engine.live_db`` function.

**Live-path surface (only what ``engine/dispatch.py`` invokes when the
executor is ``LiveExecutor`` — statuses rejected / pending):**

* ``record_rejected`` → CAS ``pending → rejected`` of the C1 row via
  :func:`live.state.transition_pending_to_rejected` (rejected branch,
  non-``stale_book`` only; ``stale_book`` is the paper-side reject path that
  ``dispatch.py`` short-circuits before the store). NOT an insert — spec §3
  supersedes B's CR-4 insert-on-outcome model; a CAS-miss / write failure is
  a logged ERROR audit gap, NOT fatal (§3.1: a rejected order holds no
  position ⇒ not funds-at-risk).
* ``record_pending`` → :func:`live.state.record_pending` (pending branch —
  NetworkError / malformed-fills / engine-timeout).
* ``get_open_trades`` / ``get_open_trades_for`` → ``live_trades`` open-row
  reads (dispatch builds ``TickContext.open_positions`` so live strategies
  can see their positions and emit exit Signals).
* ``close`` → close the held connection (idempotent).

So this adapter's live WRITE responsibility is **intent / pending /
rejected persistence + the filled-entry CAS transition + open-row reads**.
The post-fill lifecycle (exit / partial-exit / settlement / strategy
state) is still NOT this adapter's job (see ``PR-5 → PR-6 (E) CONTRACT``).

**``record_trade`` (E / C2) — the LIVE filled-entry write is a CAS
``pending → open`` TRANSITION of the C1 row, NOT an insert** (spec §3
``:400 filled`` row / §4.2 / §5). The entry model is
insert-pending-then-CAS-transition: C1's ``record_intent`` durably INSERTs
the ``pending`` row keyed by ``client_order_id`` *before* ``place()``;
dispatch's filled branch then calls ``record_trade(...)`` UNCONDITIONALLY
(it must never branch on paper-vs-live — spec §1 keystone). On the live
store ``record_trade`` locates that C1 row by ``client_order_id`` (B's
canonical lookup) and CAS-transitions it to ``open`` via
:func:`live.state.transition_pending_to_open` — exactly one row remains,
now ``status='open'`` with the real ``kalshi_order_id`` set and the fill
fields populated. ``client_order_id`` / ``kalshi_order_id`` reach it as
additive keyword-only Protocol args (paper / in-memory accept-and-ignore
them so their behaviour is byte-identical — G-parity-guarded; the live
store consumes them). No synthesized ids, no competing INSERT (§4.2): the
funds-at-risk row 4.B's reconciler / ``on_fill_event`` / phantom-pending
poller key off is the SAME C1 row, now transitioned.

**Post-fill lifecycle (``exit_trade`` / ``settle_trade`` /
``get_trade_by_id``) — LIVE-CORRECT (E / C5).** ``TradeStoreProtocol``
EXPOSES these (dispatch's paper path + tests call them), so for LIVE they
route to B's CAS close (``live.state.record_close``), NOT the paper single
``status='open' → won/lost`` UPDATE and NOT fail-loud:

* ``exit_trade`` — full close via ``record_close`` (UPDATE-in-place, CAS
  precondition ``status IN ('open','exit_pending')``, entry-fee-remainder
  consumed). won/lost/scratch + pnl + exit-fee arithmetic mirrors B's
  ``ws_handlers.on_fill_event`` full-close path byte-for-byte (the
  Protocol's ``exit_trade`` carries no ``closed_size``/exit-order-id, so it
  is structurally a FULL close — ``record_partial_exit`` is the WS-handler
  split path, never reachable here).
* ``settle_trade`` — settlement close via ``record_close`` with
  ``exit_reason='settlement'``, binary 100/0, ``exit_fee_cents=0`` (spec
  §423), supersedes ``exit_pending``; won/lost by side-vs-result mirrors
  B's ``_settlement_outcome`` / ``_settlement_pnl_cents``.
* ``get_trade_by_id`` — canonical by-``id`` read (B ships none;
  ``engine.live_db`` is risk-reads only) returning paper's 18-key dict, or
  ``None`` if absent. Pure read — no fatality concern.

In live PRODUCTION the AUTHORITATIVE close is recorded by B's async WS
handler / reconciler (``record_close``/``record_partial_exit``) directly
against ``live_trades.db`` (spec §3 table ``:534/:537``; integration test
#26 proves it); D3 (later) rewires dispatch to NOT call ``store.exit_trade``
synchronously in live mode. These methods make the Protocol surface
live-correct so the seam is sound regardless of when D3 lands. **Fatality:
caller-owned best-effort, NEVER ``RecordPendingFailed``** — a close acts on
a real-money OPEN position, but the position's correct eventual close is
GUARANTEED by B's authoritative async reconciler/WS handler, NOT this
synchronous method; B's own ``record_close`` makes a lost CAS race a logged
WARNING no-op and never raises; raising here would HALT the engine —
strictly worse for a funds-at-risk open position than logging ERROR and
letting B's reconciler close it (a halt stops B's reconciler/WS loop too).
Same uniform taxonomy as C3/C4 (see the section header above
``settle_trade``).

**Strategy-state methods — Phase-1 INTENTIONAL no-op** (``save_state``,
``load_state``, ``load_all_states``): resolved by SC-E3b (spec §10 / CR-3).
The live trader starts FLAT every boot — zero inherited positions; the
open book is rehydrated from ``live_trades.db`` by B's reconciler
(``startup_reconcile``), NOT from a store-owned ``strategy_state`` table.
Phase-1 strategy state is reconstructable, so a restart is a flat start:
``load_all_states`` returns ``{}``, ``load_state`` returns the empty-state
default ``{}``, ``save_state`` is a no-op. This is the spec-INTENDED
Phase-1 behaviour (the store absorbs the paper/live difference — the §1/§3
keystone — so ``run_engine`` carries NO ``if live:`` strategy-state
branch), NOT a weakening: strategy state is not money logic (the money
path — ``record_*`` / ``exit_trade`` / ``settle_trade`` / ``get_*`` —
remains fully implemented + C5-correct). A future phase MAY add real
cross-restart live strategy-state if Phase-2 needs it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**PR-5 → PR-6 (E) CONTRACT — read before wiring this store into a live run.**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

``SQLiteTradeStore`` is the live **intent / pending / rejected persistence
+ filled-entry CAS + open-row read** boundary. As shipped in PR 5 the
merged ``engine/dispatch.py`` had **no live-vs-paper branching**:
``_handle_signal`` routes every exit Signal to ``_handle_exit``, which
unconditionally calls ``store.exit_trade(...)`` then
``store.get_trade_by_id(...)``; the filled branch unconditionally calls
``store.record_trade(...)``. E (C2) makes ``record_trade`` live-correct (a
CAS ``pending → open`` transition — above); the exit / settlement arms are
still **fail-loud** against this adapter until E's later phases redirect
them.

Therefore, **before any live run, E (PR 6) MUST also rewire dispatch** so
that, when the executor is ``LiveExecutor``:

(a) **filled-entry branch** → ``store.record_trade(...)`` now CAS-
    transitions the C1 ``pending`` row to ``open`` via
    :func:`live.state.transition_pending_to_open` with D's real
    ``kalshi_order_id`` (passed as the additive keyword-only arg) —
    DONE (E / C2). (``LiveExecutor.place`` returns ``status="filled"``
    synchronously for Kalshi IOC, so this is the common live entry path,
    not an edge case.)
(b) **exit Signal path** — the STORE side is DONE (E / C5):
    ``store.exit_trade`` / ``store.get_trade_by_id`` now route to B's CAS
    close (``record_close``) / the canonical by-id read. The remaining
    obligation is the DISPATCH rewire (D3, later): route the exit Signal
    through D's executor so the AUTHORITATIVE close is B's async
    WS/reconciler against ``live_trades.db``, not a synchronous
    ``store.exit_trade`` call. C5's store impls keep the Protocol surface
    live-correct so the seam is sound regardless of when D3 lands.
(c) **settlement path** — the STORE side is DONE (E / C5):
    ``store.settle_trade`` routes to B's settlement CAS close
    (``record_close`` ``exit_reason='settlement'``, entry-fee-remainder
    consumed, supersedes ``exit_pending``). The AUTHORITATIVE settlement
    close in production is B's settlement handler; the dispatch wiring is a
    later E phase.

C5 makes ``exit_trade`` / ``get_trade_by_id`` / ``settle_trade``
LIVE-CORRECT (B-CAS-close routing — above), so they are NO LONGER
fail-loud. Closing E-obligation #1 makes the
``tests/test_live_store.py`` strict-xfail twin
(``test_pr6_contract_xfails_when_e_implements_live_lifecycle``) XPASS — a
CI-fail BY DESIGN (the forcing function: the 4 live lifecycle methods no
longer raise). E's dedicated test-cleanup phase (C6) retires that pair and
rewrites the green-guard to assert the implemented behaviour. C5 does NOT
modify those tests (C6's chartered scope).

🚨 **Real-money invariant — ``RecordPendingFailed`` MUST propagate.**
``record_pending`` is the funds-at-risk INSERT this adapter performs on the
live path: a failed INSERT means a Kalshi-side order is stranded with no
local row for B's reconciler to find. ``live.state.record_pending`` raises
:class:`RecordPendingFailed` in that case; this adapter does **pure
delegation with no try/except around the call**, so the exception propagates
uncaught — which is what the three ``except RecordPendingFailed: raise``
ghost-reject clauses in ``dispatch.process_tick`` / ``engine._ws_loop`` /
``engine`` outer reconnect depend on to halt the engine.
(:func:`live.state.record_open` raises the SAME exception for the same
reason on the filled-entry INSERT, but that call is made by E's PR-6 wiring
directly against ``live.state`` — NOT through this adapter — so the
ghost-reject contract there is E's to preserve, not this store's.) The
``record_rejected`` audit-write best-effort carve-out (a failed
``pending → rejected`` CAS, or a CAS-miss because the C-gate rejected the
order *before* C1 inserted a pending row, strands at most an audit gap —
no Kalshi position, no money) is **caller-owned here, not inherited**: B's
``transition_pending_to_rejected`` owns only a lost-CAS-race WARNING no-op
(not a write-failure carve-out), so ``record_rejected`` wraps the whole
locate+CAS in its own ``try/except`` that logs ERROR and does NOT raise
(mirroring the PR#34 ``438d843`` precedent). This is a converged, locked
§3.1 tradeoff that partially supersedes B's CR-4 audit-completeness for the
positionless-rejected case — INTENTIONAL, not a regression.

	(``transition_pending_to_open`` → ``open`` and sets the fill fields;
	``transition_pending_to_rejected`` → ``rejected``/``rejected_post_hoc``,

	``client_order_id``), with only ``kalshi_order_id`` learned. C4's task
	contract explicitly sanctions "a single targeted guarded UPDATE on the

	This is that single UPDATE, mirroring B's canonical CAS-predicate idiom
	verbatim (``WHERE id = ? AND status = '<precondition>'`` — identical shape
	to ``transition_pending_to_open`` / ``touch_reconciled`` in

	reconciler / a fill landed) is an idempotent no-op (``rowcount == 0``),
	never a blind clobber of a transitioned row. ``B._cas_update`` is a private

		11-kwarg signature; pinned by
		``tests/test_engine_dispatch_pending_branch.py``). The durable
		``pending`` row ALREADY EXISTS from C1's ``record_intent`` (INSERTed
		pre-place, keyed by ``client_order_id``); this method only learns the
		``kalshi_order_id`` (a NetworkError/timeout OrderResult may still carry
		one) and keeps ``status='pending'`` (still unknown — B's reconciler
		resolves it later via ``client_order_id``).

		Flow:

		1. Locate the C1 ``pending`` row by ``client_order_id`` using B's
		   canonical lookup query (the same ``WHERE client_order_id = ?``
		   SELECT ``live.state`` itself / the reconciler / ``record_trade`` /
		   ``record_rejected`` use — NOT hand-rolled SQL; §5). The select is
		   extended to ``SELECT id, status`` so the pre-state rides the SAME
		   round-trip. ``client_order_id`` is ``UNIQUE`` ⇒ at most one row.
		2. If a non-empty ``kalshi_order_id`` is now known, BACKFILL it onto
		   that row via :func:`_backfill_pending_kalshi_order_id` (the single
		   sanctioned targeted CAS UPDATE — B ships no ``kalshi_order_id``-only
		   backfill writer; ``status='pending'`` CAS predicate ⇒ idempotent,
		   no clobber of a row that concurrently transitioned). A NULL/empty id
		   (pure NetworkError, no id returned) is left as-is — never null out
		   an id C1 or a prior call already set (idempotent).

		**§3.1 NORMATIVE — caller-owned best-effort, NOT fatal (the INVERSE of
		C1's ``record_intent``, like C3's ``record_rejected``):** post-place
		``record_pending`` backfill failure ⇒ NOT fatal (log ERROR, continue).
		The durable row already exists from ``record_intent``; B's reconciler
		owns recovery via ``client_order_id``. Raising here would needlessly
		halt the engine over an audit-grade backfill miss while the
		funds-at-risk invariant is already satisfied. Contrast:

		* **C1 ``record_intent`` — FATAL.** Its INSERT precedes ``place()``;
		  the row does NOT exist yet, so a failure strands a funds-at-risk
		  order with no local row → ``RecordPendingFailed`` propagates uncaught
		  and the engine's ghost-reject clauses halt it. C4 is the opposite:
		  the row ALREADY exists, nothing to strand.
		* **C3 ``record_rejected`` — CAS ``pending → rejected``, best-effort.**
		  Same §3.1 not-fatal posture; C4 differs only in that the CAS keeps
		  ``status='pending'`` (state still unknown) instead of moving to a
		  terminal ``rejected``.

		Failure modes (all best-effort — log ERROR, never raise, never
		``RecordPendingFailed``; ghost-reject scope is funds-at-risk
		pre-place INSERTs only):

		* **Row-not-found (no preceding C1 ``record_intent`` — defense in
		  depth):** log ERROR audit gap and return. Do NOT fabricate a
		  competing INSERT (that would resurrect B's superseded
		  insert-on-outcome model; spec §3). B's reconciler is the backstop via
		  ``client_order_id`` (mirrors C3's CAS-miss posture).
		* **Backfill write failure — two carve-outs (both best-effort, never
		  raise), mirroring C3's ``record_rejected`` split so an operator can
		  triage faster:** ``sqlite3.Error`` is the transient/environmental
		  disk/DB fault (or a CAS lost-race no-op) — log ERROR and continue; a
		  non-DB ``Exception`` is flagged DISTINCTLY as an UNEXPECTED error (a
		  possible permanent B-API/signature drift) which would otherwise
		  log-and-continue forever with zero backfills — an operator should
		  escalate that class. The C1 row is intact either way (the targeted
		  CAS UPDATE applied or no-op'd — it never half-writes); B's reconciler
		  resolves the row via ``client_order_id`` regardless.

		This partially supersedes B's CR-4 insert-on-outcome for the
		executor-pending case — a converged, locked §3 / §3.1 tradeoff,
		INTENTIONAL, not a regression.

		model: "the live entry model is insert-pending-then-CAS-transition,

		Dispatch's rejected branch (non-``stale_book`` only; ``stale_book`` is

		never branch on paper-vs-live (spec §1 keystone) — so the paper-shaped
		Protocol signature is preserved verbatim (the locked 10-kwarg
		signature, no ``kalshi_order_id``; ``rejection_reason`` REQUIRED;
		pinned by ``tests/test_engine_dispatch_pending_branch.py``).

		Flow:

		1. Locate the C1 ``pending`` row by ``client_order_id`` using B's
		   canonical lookup query (the same ``WHERE client_order_id = ?``
		   SELECT ``live.state`` itself / the reconciler / ``record_trade``
		   use — NOT hand-rolled SQL; §5). The select is extended to
		   ``SELECT id, status`` so the pre-CAS status is captured in the
		   SAME round-trip (no extra read vs B's ``_status_of``).
		   ``client_order_id`` is ``UNIQUE`` so this is at most one row.
		2. CAS ``pending → rejected`` via B's
		   :func:`live.state.transition_pending_to_rejected`
		   (``kalshi_order_id=None`` — a rejected order never got a Kalshi
		   id on this path). On a won CAS (pre-status was ``pending``) the
		   normal path stays quiet (B emits its own ``pending→rejected``
		   INFO). A LOST CAS race (the row had already left ``pending``) is
		   surfaced DISTINCTLY here on THIS module's coid-keyed audit logger
		   WITH the business keys (``client_order_id`` / ``rejection_reason``
		   / actual current status) — B's ``_cas_update`` only emits a
		   generic WARNING keyed by ``row_id`` on the ``edge_catcher.live.state``
		   logger (no coid, no reason), invisible on the store's audit trail.
		   The dangerous sub-case is a ``status='open'`` row (the order
		   FILLED): a subsequent ``record_rejected`` for the same coid means
		   the system believes one order both filled AND was rejected — a
		   fill/reject ORDERING ANOMALY (a real-money concern the zero-error
		   lens targets), logged explicitly as such; any other terminal
		   pre-status (``rejected`` / ``rejected_post_hoc`` / ``cancelled``)
		   is the benign late/duplicate-reject variant. Either way this is a
		   best-effort observability log, NOT a raise (spec §3.1 — a rejected
		   order holds no position).

		**§3.1 best-effort — caller-owned, NOT fatal (unlike C1's
		``record_intent``):** ``record_intent`` failure is FATAL
		(``RecordPendingFailed`` propagates, entry aborts BEFORE ``place()``
		— a funds-at-risk INSERT). ``record_rejected`` is the inverse: a
		rejected order **holds no position**, so per spec §3.1
		("``record_rejected`` CAS-miss/failure ⇒ NOT fatal,
		audit-best-effort, log ERROR … a rejected order holds no position")
		every failure mode here is a logged ERROR audit gap, never a raise:

		* **CAS-miss (no preceding C1 ``pending`` row):** the spec author
		  KNEW pre-place C-gate rejects (``absolute_max_exceeded`` /
		  ``invalid_intended_size``) reject the order BEFORE C1 inserts a
		  pending row, and DELIBERATELY accepted that as a logged audit gap,
		  NOT fatal. Log ERROR and return — do NOT raise, do NOT INSERT a
		  fabricated row (that would resurrect B's superseded
		  insert-on-outcome model; spec §3).
		* **Lost CAS race (row found but not ``pending``):** surfaced
		  DISTINCTLY on this store's coid-keyed audit logger with the
		  business keys + the actual current status, explicitly flagged as a
		  fill/reject ordering anomaly when the row is ``open`` (real-money
		  concern) vs benign late/duplicate reject otherwise. Best-effort log
		  only — never raise (the row exists and is terminal/filled; nothing
		  to strand).
		* **Write failure — categorized into two carve-outs (both
		  best-effort, never raise):** B's ``transition_pending_to_rejected``
		  owns only the lost-race WARNING no-op, NOT a write-failure
		  carve-out, so the CALLER owns the ``try/except`` (PR#34 ``438d843``
		  precedent). It is split so an operator can triage faster:
		  ``sqlite3.Error`` is the transient/environmental disk/DB fault (the
		  documented §3.1 carve-out — mirrors B's ``record_pending``
		  ``except sqlite3.Error``); a non-DB ``Exception`` is flagged
		  DISTINCTLY as an UNEXPECTED error (a possible permanent
		  B-API/signature drift, e.g. a wrong kwarg) which would otherwise
		  log-and-continue forever with zero rejected audit rows — an
		  operator should escalate that class. Neither raises
		  ``RecordPendingFailed`` (ghost-reject scope is funds-at-risk
		  INSERTs only).

		keyword-only args (paper / in-memory accept-and-ignore; the live

		   fill_size)))`` — byte-identical to
		   ``ws_handlers._entry_fee_cents`` /
		   ``reconciliation._resolve_matched_pending`` so F's P&L does not

		   ``entry_price`` for the cost basis, mirroring paper
		   ``record_trade``'s ``blended_entry or entry_price`` rule so the
		   fee is never computed off a 0¢ basis.
		3. CAS ``pending → open`` via B's

		bookkeeping is store-agnostic.

		``client_order_id`` is required on the live path (dispatch always
		generates D's idempotency key before ``record_intent``); a missing /
		unmatched one is a wiring bug and raises loudly rather than silently
		inserting an unreconcilable row (zero-error lens). ``kalshi_order_id``

	# CAS close (`live.state.record_close`), NOT the paper single-UPDATE and
	# NOT fail-loud — a silent paper-shaped UPDATE on the `live_trades` schema
	# would be a real-money correctness hole. In live PRODUCTION the
	# AUTHORITATIVE close is recorded by B's async WS handler / reconciler
	# (`record_close`/`record_partial_exit`) directly against live_trades.db
	# (spec §3 table `:534/:537`; integration test #26 proves it); D3 (later,
	# controller-tracked) rewires dispatch to NOT call `store.exit_trade`
	# synchronously in live mode. These store methods make the Protocol
	# surface live-correct so the seam is sound regardless of when D3 lands.
	#
	# FATALITY (the genuinely-new funds-at-risk question — reasoned from B's
	# ACTUAL contract + spec §3.1, NOT guessed): caller-owned BEST-EFFORT,
	# NEVER `RecordPendingFailed`. A close acts on a real-money OPEN position,
	# BUT the position's correct eventual close is GUARANTEED by B's
	# authoritative async reconciler / WS handler — NOT by this synchronous
	# store method. B's own `record_close` makes a lost CAS race a logged
	# WARNING no-op and NEVER raises (settlement-vs-exit-fill is B's EXPECTED
	# idempotent outcome — `_cas_update`: a lost CAS is "the correct
	# idempotent outcome … never an error"). `RecordPendingFailed`/ghost-
	# reject scope is funds-at-risk PRE-PLACE INSERTs ONLY (spec §3.1; PR#34
	# `438d843`); a terminal close is not one. Crucially, raising here would
	# HALT the engine — strictly WORSE for a funds-at-risk open position than
	# logging ERROR and letting B's reconciler close it: a halted engine stops
	# B's reconciler/WS loop too, removing the very recovery mechanism (the
	# exact §3.1 `record_pending` rationale — "Raising here would needlessly
	# halt the engine … while the funds-at-risk invariant is already
	# satisfied"). So the SAME uniform failure-taxonomy/observability as
	# C3/C4 (distinct ERROR, business keys, sqlite3.Error-vs-unexpected
	# split). Contrast: C1 `record_intent` FATAL (pre-place INSERT, row does
	# not exist yet → strands a funds-at-risk order); C2 `record_trade` CAS
	# pending→open (loud-fails a wiring bug — a missing identity key); C3
	# `record_rejected` / C4 `record_pending` best-effort (positionless /
	# durable-row-already-exists). C5 = the post-fill terminal close:
	# best-effort because B's authoritative ASYNC close path owns recovery —
